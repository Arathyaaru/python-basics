#loop through the index number

#use the range ()and  len() functions to create a suitable iterable.


#print all items by referring to their index number?

thislist = ["apple", "banana","cherry"]

for k in range(len(thislist)):
    print(thislist[k])

# the iterable created in the example above is {0, 1, 2].
